<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/BESHAM0N/CatJam/raw/main/preview.gif" width="480"/> </div>

CatJam is a small arcade-style reaction game made as a pet project.
Your goal is to free kittens from their cages by tapping the correct tiles before the timer runs out.
Each correct tap adds extra time, but a mistake drains the timer heavily and may instantly lead to defeat.

The real challenge is to keep the timer alive and push your score as high as possible.
