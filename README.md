CatJam is a small arcade-style reaction game made as a pet project.
Your goal is to free kittens from their cages by tapping the correct tiles before the timer runs out.
Each correct tap adds extra time, but a mistake drains the timer heavily and may instantly lead to defeat.

The real challenge is to keep the timer alive and push your score as high as possible.

🌟 Features

🐈 Cute kitten animations and responsive visual feedback.

❌ Harsh penalty for mistakes — a wrong tap cuts off a big chunk of time.

🧩 Increasing difficulty as the grid grows and kittens appear more often.

🎵 Sound toggle in the settings menu.

🏆 Leaderboard screen with animated nickname input.

🎨 Hand-drawn cozy art style with forests, stars, and a magical cat guide.
